This program is used to query CUDA devices and specifications, outputs a summary, including the CUDA driver version, CUDA runtime version, 
and the number of CUDA devices detected. It serves as a utility to inspect and gather 
information about CUDA-capable GPUs installed on a system.
It also checks if peer-to-peer memory access is possible between two CUDA devices, 
which is supported by certain combinations of CUDA-capable GPUs.

With this I can understand the capabilities and specifications of their CUDA devices.
