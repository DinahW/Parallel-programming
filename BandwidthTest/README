 This  program measures the memcopy bandwidth of the GPU.
 It can measure device to device copy bandwidth, host to device copy bandwidth
 for pageable and pinned memory, and device to host copy bandwidth for pageable
 and pinned memory.

The results show that:
Pageable and Pinned Memory : Using pinned memory generally results in higher bandwidth for both Host to
Device and Device to Host transfers due to reduced overhead and better optimization 
of the data transfer process.

GPU Model Variation: Different GPUs will have varying bandwidth capabilities. 
Higher-end models designed for compute-intensive tasks generally exhibit higher bandwidth

It was observed that considering different GPUs tesla_v100:1 has the highest bandwidth followed by 
rtx_a6000:1 then tesla_t4:1
