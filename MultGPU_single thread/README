The provided code performs a 1D Jacobi iterative solver on a specified problem size (N) over a number of time steps (TSTEPS). 
It utilizes both CPU and GPU (CUDA) implementations to solve the problem and compares their results for correctness

The primary metric to determine the success of the GPU implementation is whether the 
output arrays a_output From Gpu and b_output From Gpu match the CPU results (a and b) 
within the defined percentage difference threshold.

If the test passes (fail == 0), it indicates that the GPU implementation produces results 
consistent with the CPU, validating the correctness of the parallel implementation.

If the test fails (fail > 0), it suggests discrepancies between CPU and GPU results beyond 
the acceptable threshold, indicating potential issues in the GPU implementation.
