The first part of the code 
Every thread prints one character of the message HELLO WORLD

hello<<<1, 1>>>(); launches the kernel with 1 block and 1 thread per block. 
This means the kernel will execute once on the GPU.

cudaDeviceSynchronize();: This function call ensures that the CPU waits for all 
previously issued CUDA commands to complete before continuing.

After synchronization, "HELLO WORLD" is printed to the console

Second part
hello<<< 1, 16>>>();
When we change 12 to 16, any random character after the 12 is printed out 
since HELLO WORLD has only 12 characters 

hello<<< 2, 12 >>>();: 
Launches the hello kernel with 2 blocks and 12 threads per block.
HELLO WORLD is printed twice.

hello<<< 2, 16>>>();
