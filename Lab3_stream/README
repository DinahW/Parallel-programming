This programs a STREAM benchmark used to measure sustainable memory bandwidth.
The output details various aspects of the benchmark run, including system memory usage, number of threads, and performance of different memory operations (Copy, Scale, Add, Triad). 
In the first case, considering different system information with a higher number of threads, the bandwidth is higher
compared to when we have few threads.

The bandwidth tends to reduce as we reduce on the number of threads for the second and third scenarios.
