ALL THE CODE THAT NEEDS FIXING HAS BEEN FIXED AND COMMENTED ON FIXED


The program shows two kernels performing matrix multiplication, 
before and after optimization using blocking or tiling the matrix.

The results print out an error, result status, Matrix size, Tile size
and the throughput of the simple and optimized kernels.

Performance Improvement:
The throughput of the optimized kernel (matrix_multiply) is observed
to be higher than that of the simple kernel (matrix_multiply_simple). 
This indicates that the optimization has improved computational efficiency.

Both "Simple Result" and "Optimized Result" indicate "PASS", 
meaning that both versions computed the matrix multiplication correctly.

Both versions produce results within an acceptable error margin (eps). The error checking ensures that the optimized
version maintains correctness while improving performance
