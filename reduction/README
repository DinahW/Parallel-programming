The program demonstrates the results of  7 versions of the parallel reduction kernels 
optimized for different scenarios ensuring efficient utilization of GPU resources like 
shared memory and thread synchronization mechanisms.

Each kernel targets different aspects of performance optimization, such as minimizing bank conflicts, 
reducing warp divergence, and utilizing warp shuffle operations.
