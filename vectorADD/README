This program aims at modifying the vector addition program 
so that it uses UVM.

Unified Virtual Memory pointers (array_a, array_b, array_c) are used instead of separate host and device pointers.
These pointers are allocated with cudaMallocManaged, which allocates memory 
accessible by both the CPU and GPU.

The kernel Launch, Data initialization, results, and memory deallocation almost remain the 
same but instead of host_array_a or device_array_a we use UVM pointers (array_a,array_b,array_c)

No need for managing separate host and device memories or perfrom data transfers
using cudaMemcpy.
