The program demonstrates the results of  7 versions of the parallel reduction kernels 
optimized for different scenarios ensuring efficient utilization of GPU resources like 
shared memory and thread synchronization mechanisms.

Each kernel targets different aspects of performance optimization, such as minimizing bank conflicts, 
reducing warp divergence, and utilizing warp shuffle operations.

The various screenshots shot a varying throughput for the different kernels
./reduction kernel=0, ./reduction kernel=1 upto 6 used to execute  kernel version (kernel=1 up to kernel=6) 
within  reduction.

Results show that the effective bandwidth is highest for kernel 6 which uses Multiple adds/threads with 319.55GB/s and 155.2GB/s as the lowest
for Kernel 0 that utilizes interleaved addressing.
