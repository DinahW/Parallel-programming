The program  performs 1D stencil operation
1st kernel: stencil_1D_simple
Performs stencil with a radius 3 on 1D array
It computes the stencil sum for each element considering the radius
It iterates over the range [-RADIUS, RADIUS] and sums the input values.

2nd kernel: stencil_1D_improved
Uses shared memory to eliminate redundant memory accesses
It ensures all threads synchronize after loading data into shared memory before performing the stencil computation
